pprint, pretty print 
want it to replace java
join? false so compojure doesn't block (get your repl back)

watch out for the primitive math operations, use meta ^long hints in args and return types.  doesn't keep you completely safe from boxing if you pass into non-primitive supporting functions.

(set! *warn-on-reflection* true)

if dealing with data structures, most are in these namespaces:
clojure.core
clojure.set
clojure.data
clojure.zip
combinatorix

private functions:
^:private
@#'var
OR 
defn- (a macro)

*e - last exception in repl
*1 - last value in repl

Macros:
"a free-standing program that extends the language"
"meta-programming"
functional transformation from data structures to data structures

macro emits code
passed args unevaluated
makes you think carefully about time when writing macros
don't use them unless you need to take control of time/state
is not about special eval properties

-How to write/think about macros
write what you want to write
and what you want it to become
then write macro to transform it
use macroexpand-1 to try it at the repl

"when you need polymorphism in clojure use protocol" -Stu H.
"prototype in multimethods, and if you can live within protocol restrictions, make the switch" -Stu S.

Protocols don't have to live in classes
